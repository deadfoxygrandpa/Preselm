# Preselm

A tool for creating presentations in Elm.

In order to make a presentation, create an Elm file with the
presentation content, for example my-presentation.elm, and compile it
together with the Preselm.elm file. Here is how you could do it:

    elm --make my-presentation.elm

If the compilation is successful, the my-presentation.html file with
your presentation should be created.
